\section{Motivation}

Let us start with an example to motivate our
approach. 

\subsection{Motivating Example}

\begin{table}
    \centering
    %    \footnotesize
    \small
    \caption{The \textsf{Users} database table~\cite{icsm13}}\label{tab:users-table}

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Table~\ref{tab:users-table} shows an example of a database
table with four records on four persons. The table \code{Users} has
four rows corresponding to four data records. The columns of the table
represent the {\em attributes} of each record. In this example, the
data record shows the \code{ID}, \code{Name}, \code{Age},
\code{Gender}, and \code{Country} for each person. For example, the
first row shows the information for a person with the name of
\code{Alice}. In a dynamic Web application, the data can be retrieved
and updated from PHP code with the embedded SQL queries as we will
explain next. For example, one can construct the following SQL query
in a PHP program as in \code{``SELECT Name FROM Users WHERE Age =
  20''}. The result is a {\em result set} containing the names of all
users whose age is 20.

%Web applications are often developed with dynamic data. The data is
%usually stored in databases, such as in the table shown in
%Table~\ref{tab:users-table}. The \code{Users} database table
%contains four rows (\emph{data records}). The five columns of the
%table indicate five \emph{attributes} associated with each record. For
%example, the first record has the information on a user with
%the attributes \code{ID=1, Name=Alice, Age=20, Gender=Female}, and
%\code{Country=USA}. This data can then be accessed or updated from the
%Web application through SQL queries. For instance, the SQL query
%\code{``SELECT Name FROM Users WHERE Age = 20''} returns a
%\emph{result set} containing the names of all users whose age is
%20.

As a PHP-based Web application communicates with a database, a fault
might occur at the code responsible for such
interaction. Figure~\ref{fig:example-phpcode} shows the PHP code that
contains a fault in its SQL query at line 3, resulting the incorrect
output. The goal of the function in Figure~\ref{fig:example-phpcode}
is to display the records of the persons whose ages are greater than
the specified age, and the genders and countries match with the
specified ones. However, the developer made a mistake at the PHP code
to construct the SQL query: the operator in the last predicate
\code{Country $<>$ `\$country'} should be \code{`='}, instead of
\code{`$<>$'}. The string representing this SQL query is constructed
from the string literals at line 3 and the arguments \code{age},
\code{gender}, and \code{country}, after the code responsible for the
preparation of the connection to the database at lines 1--2. The query
is sent to the database server to be executed at line 4 via the PHP
function \code{mysql\_query}. The result set is stored in the variable
\code{result}. Because the query is incorrect, the output result is
not correct as a consequence (lines 5--7 are used to loop through the
result set and display the users' names matched from the search).

%As a Web application interacts with a database through SQL queries,
%database-specific failures can occur. Fig.~\ref{fig:example-phpcode}
%shows an example of a PHP function that produces incorrect output
%values due to an error in its SQL query. The purpose of the function
%is to display the names of the users from the \code{Users} table
%(Table~\ref{tab:users-table}) that satisfy a searching criteria (by
%\code{age, gender}, or \code{country}). First, the connection to the
%database is established (lines 1-2,
%Fig.~\ref{fig:example-phpcode}). The \code{\$sql} variable (line 3)
%contains the SQL query that retrieves the users' names for a given
%search input. This query is then sent to the database server to be
%executed via the PHP function \code{mysql\_query} (line 4), and the
%returned result set is stored in the variable
%%\code{\$result}. Finally, the code on lines 5-7 is used to loop
%through the records in the result set and display the corresponding
%names of the users found via the search. Note that this function
%contains an SQL fault: on line 3, the operator in the last predicate
%\code{Country $<>$ `\$country'} of the SQL query should be \code{`='}
%instead of \code{`$<>$'}.

Due to that error, the output result is
unexpected. Figure~\ref{fig:example-output} shows actual and expected
SQL queries and their corresponding output results given the search
input \code{\$age=25, \$gender=`Female', \$country=`USA'}. Because
the SQL query was incorrectly constructed at the last predicate, the
actual output is not the expected one. The records of Alice and Daniel
are supposed to be retrieved, however, were left out. The record of
Bob was returned and included in the output, while it must not.

%Due to that error in the SQL query, the function does~not display the
%expected results. Fig.~\ref{fig:example-output} shows the actual and
%expected output values given the search input \code{\$age=25,
%\$gender=`Female', \$country=`USA'}. In the correct SQL query, the
%three-predicate condition determining the values in the returned
%result set is: \code{Age $>=$ 25} \code{AND} \code{Gender = `Female'}
%\code{OR} \code{Country = `USA'}. Since the actual query has a fault
%in the last predicate, there is a mismatch between its actual and
%expected outputs. As seen, Alice's and Daniel's names are expected to
%be found in the result, but are not displayed. Meanwhile, Bob's name
%is included in the actual output although it must not.

%Given the mismatch between the actual output and the expected one, 

%Tien

It is challenging to localize such fault causing that errorenous
output. The error was made in the construction of the string
representing the SQL query within the PHP code. In other words, the
error occurs within the embedded string in the PHP code.  Even more
challenging is the fact that the execution of the query is done at the
database server, which is separate from where the PHP program is
executed to create the SQL query. In brief, to localize this kind of
faults/bugs, a tool needs to be {\em database-aware}, i.e., need to
consider the communications between PHP-based Web application and the
database via the queries.


%Given such mismatch, it is not obvious which part of the program
%accounts for the error. In this example, the fault lies at a predicate
%of an SQL query, whereas the Web application is written in
%PHP. Moreover, the actual execution of the SQL query occurs at the
%database server, which is separate from the main PHP program where the
%SQL query is created. Thus, the process of localizing this type of
%fault needs to be \emph{database-aware}, namely taking into account
%the interaction between the Web application and the database via
%queries.

Although there exist many fault localization techniques for
single-language programs (e.g. \cite{abreu-ochiai-07},
\cite{tarantula05}), \cite{liblit-pldi05}), and data-centric programs
(e.g. \cite{dor-issta08}, \cite{litvak10}, \cite{saha11}), little
attention has been given to database-specific faults in a multilingual
Web application.
%
A state-of-the-art approach in database-aware fault localization for
Web applications is Clark {\em et al.}~\cite{ga-ase11}. Their tool
monitors the execution of the PHP statements in the main program and
that of the generated SQL queries. It then assigns the
\emph{suspiciousness} scores to the PHP statements as well as the SQL
queries using the idea from the spectrum-based fault localization
approaches (Tarantula~\cite{tarantula05} and
Ochiai~\cite{abreu-ochiai-07}).
%monitors SQL queries generated at runtime and compute the
%\emph{suspiciousness} scores for those SQL queries and their
%attributes, as well as the statements in the main program.
%
The rationale in computing suspiciousness scores is to contrast the
runtime behaviors of correct and incorrect executions of the program.
If a program entity (program statement or predicate) is exercised by
more failing test cases than passing ones, it is more likely to be
responsible for the failure, and thus assigned with a higher
suspiciousness~score.

Let us explain how Clark {\em et al.}'s method~\cite{ga-ase11} works
in the database-aware fashion. It assigns the suspiciousness scores to
the program entities including PHP statements, SQL queries, and SQL
attributes.  Fig.~\ref{fig:suspiciousness} illustrates the computation
of suspiciousness scores for our running example. Line 4 shows
the PHP statement with \code{mysql\_query} while line 4$\ast$ displays
the SQL query produced by the code at line 4 at run-time. We use
the question marks to denote the literal numbers or strings.
%
%Line 4$\ast$ shows the SQL query executed by the PHP
%statement \code{mysql\_query} on line 4 at runtime, with the question
%marks indicating literal values (numbers/strings).
%
If multiple {\em unique SQL queries}, each with a different set of
attributes, are produced by the PHP code at line 4, their tool will assign
the suspiciousness scores to individual SQL queries.
%If the PHP \code{mysql\_query} statement executes multiple
%\emph{unique} SQL queries (each with a different set of attributes) in
%different executions, the suspiciousness scores of the individual
%queries will be computed.

%Compared with the previous fault localization approaches, Clark {\em
%et al.}'s method~\cite{ga-ase11} is database-aware in that it
%considers SQL queries or SQL attributes as program entities and also
%computes their 
%suspiciousness scores. For example, Fig.~\ref{fig:suspiciousness}
%illustrates the computation of suspiciousness scores for the program
%entities in Fig.~\ref{fig:example-phpcode} including SQL
%queries. Line 4$\ast$ shows the SQL query executed by the PHP
%statement \code{mysql\_query} on line 4 at runtime, with the question
%marks indicating literal values (numbers/strings). If the PHP
%\code{mysql\_query} statement executes multiple \emph{unique} SQL
%queries (each with a different set of attributes) in different
%executions, the suspiciousness scores of the individual queries will
%be computed.

The key idea of that method is that if some SQL queries with sets of
attributes are exercised in the execution of the passing test cases
and some other queries with different sets of attributes are executed
in those of failing ones, we can distinguish them and assign more
suspiciousness scores for the queries corresponding to the failing
ones. However, the SQL queries (executed by the PHP statement
\code{mysql\_query}) in different executions often have the same set
of attributes with the same structure. They differ from one another in
the literal values in the predicates. For example, the queries in the
running example would have the same structure \code{``SELECT Name FROM
  Users WHERE Age $>$= ? AND Gender = ? OR Country $<>$ ?''}, and the
same set of attributes \code{\{Name, Age, Gender, Country\}}. The
literals for ages, genders, and countries might vary for different
queries. Because the queries all have the same structure with
different literals, the numbers of passing and failing test cases
going through each of the queries are the same. Thus, they will be
given the same suspiciousness scores as the PHP statement
\code{mysql\_query}.

%That computation is based on the idea that if some of unique
%SQL queries are executed by more failing test cases than passing ones,
%they will have higher scores. This strategy is useful when there are
%multiple unique SQL queries that expose different behaviors in passing
%and failing test cases. However, in practice, a PHP
%\code{mysql\_query} statement often executes only one SQL
%query, in which the set of attributes is fixed, and the concrete SQL
%queries in different executions have the same structure and vary only
%at the literal values. This phenomenon is also reported by the
%authors~\cite{ga-ase11}. As an illustration, the unique query
%in this example (line 4$\ast$ of Fig.~\ref{fig:suspiciousness}) is
%\code{``SELECT Name FROM Users WHERE Age $>$= ? AND Gender = ? OR
%Country $<>$ ?''}, with the set of attributes \code{\{Name, Age,
%Gender, Country\}}.

Figure~\ref{fig:suspiciousness} shows the coverage information and the
suspiciousness scores given by Clark {\em et al.}~\cite{ga-ase11}.
The rows correspond to the statements and queries, and the columns are
for the test cases. A dark circle shows the execution of a statement
in a test case. The last row shows the status of passing and failing
of the test cases. The suspiciousness scores for the rows are computed
using the Tarantula (\cite{tarantula05}) metric:
\begin{equation}
\small
\label{eq:tarantula}
    S(e) = \dfrac{\tfrac{Failed(e)}{TotalFailed}}{\tfrac{Passed(e)}{TotalPassed} + \tfrac{Failed(e)}{TotalFailed}}
\end{equation}
where $Passed(e)$ is the number of passing test cases that execute
$e$, $Failed(e)$ is the number of failing test cases that execute $e$,
and $TotalPassed$ and $TotalFailed$ are the respective total numbers
of passing and failing test cases.

%Since there is one unique SQL query executed by the PHP
%\code{mysql\_query} statement, the coverage of the SQL query in the
%passing and failing test cases is the same as the \code{mysql\_query}
%statement, and therefore its suspiciousness score does not provide
%further information about the location of the fault. In
%Fig.~\ref{fig:suspiciousness}, the bullets indicate the program
%entities that are exercised by a given test case. At the bottom row,
%the letters \code{P} and \code{F} specify a passing and failing test
%case, respectively. Column \code{Sus.} shows the suspiciousness score
%$S(e)$ for a program entity $e$ using the Tarantula
%(\cite{tarantula05}) metric:
%\begin{equation}
%\small
%\label{eq:tarantula}
%    S(e) = \dfrac{\tfrac{Failed(e)}{TotalFailed}}{\tfrac{Passed(e)}{TotalPassed} + \tfrac{Failed(e)}{TotalFailed}}
%\end{equation}
%where $Passed(e)$ is the number of passing test cases that execute
%$e$, $Failed(e)$ is the number of failing test cases that execute $e$,
%and $TotalPassed$ and $TotalFailed$ are the respective total numbers
%of passing and failing test cases.

As seen in Figure~\ref{fig:suspiciousness}, because the numbers of
passing/failing test cases going through the PHP statements and SQL
queries are the same for the statements and queries, they are all
given the same score (0.5). In fact, for any spectrum-based fault
localization methods would give the same suspiciousness score for
those lines in this example because same set of program entities is
executed in every passing or failing test case, regardless of the test
suite. Therefore, the faulty queries are not idenfied. In other words,
to localize this kind of faults, we need to develop a {\em
  database-aware} fault localization method that considers the
interaction between the PHP code and the database via the queries.

%Although there is a fault in the SQL query, its suspiciousness score
%(0.5) is the same as the PHP \code{mysql\_query} statement that
%executes it. In fact, all the program entities always have the same
%score even when a different suspiciousness metric is used, since the
%same set of program entities is executed in every passing or failing
%test case (regardless of the test suite). From those suspiciousness
%scores, no further information about the fault is gained. This
%limitation motivated us to develop a new method to better localize
%database-specific faults.

\subsection{Approach Overview}

The example illustrates an \emph{incorrect output failure} that may
occur as a Web application interacts with a database. The incorrect
%values in the
returned results are often caused by the way the data records are
selected from a database table, which is specified by the
\query{WHERE} clause of an SQL \query{SELECT} query. In this paper, we
target incorrect output failures due to errors in the \query{WHERE}
part of SQL queries. Another type of database-specific failure is
\emph{execution failure}, which occurs if the SQL query has incorrect
syntax or specifies an invalid operation with the database (e.g. the
query refers to a non-existent database table or attribute). While
execution failures can be fixed by checking the syntax of queries and
ensuring their conformance to the database schemas, incorrect output
failures are more difficult to resolve since they are caused by
semantic errors in the queries.

To learn more on SQL queries, we conducted an exploratory study. We
collected three open-source dynamic Web applications from SourceForge
(\code{AddressBook}, \code{SchoolMate}, and \code{ZenCart}) with a
total of 1,284 PHP files and 225 KLOCs. We wrote a tool to analyze
those files and found 2,518 SQL queries to the databases with 2,672
predicates in \code{WHERE} clauses. There are almost 2 SQL queries in
a PHP file. A query could have up to 10 predicates. There are 304
queries with 3-10 predicates. There are 5-25 lines of PHP code for
each SQL query. Thus, if a tool such as in Clark {\em et
al.}~\cite{ga-ase11} reports to developers that a query is faulty
without details on specific predicates, it would be not efficient for
them to locate the fault. Those numbers motivated us to develop a tool
to help localize the defects due to errors in the predicates of
\code{WHERE} clauses.

In designing our solution, we leverage the fact that the output of a
query reveals information about the correctness of individual records
in the output. If the actual output of the program does not match with
the expected one, we can further analyze individual records in the
actual output to determine which records result in the mismatch. For
example, the actual and expected outputs for the given test case in
Fig.~\ref{fig:example-output} reveal that \code{Carol} is a correct
record whereas \code{Bob} is an incorrect one. To locate the fault,
a developer would then examine the three predicates in the SQL query
that returns \code{Bob}. (S)he would recognize that two
predicates \code{Age $>$= 25} and \code{Gender = `Female'} evaluate to
\code{false} since Bob's age is \code{20} and his gender is
\code{`Male'}. Thus, the first two predicates do not contribute to the
output of \code{Bob}. Only the last predicate whose value is true
determines its presence. Thus, the last predicate is most suspicious.
%The developer could conclude that it most likely causes the fault.

% incorrect output.
%In fact, it is the source of the fault in this example.

%Note that we assume the table \code{Users} and the table column \code{Name} are correct; otherwise, it would have led to an execution failure, which is not the focus of this paper.

Based on the above ideas, we develop {\tool}, a database-aware fault
localization method that works at two levels:

(1) \tool{} localizes the {\em faulty SQL query} by monitoring the
output of individual records and computing the query's suspiciousness
score based on the correctness of these records;

(2) Given an SQL query that is likely to be faulty, \tool{} examines
the predicates in the {\em \query{WHERE} part} of the SQL query to
identify which predicate is responsible for the incorrect output.
%Next section will explain the step (1).

%, we present these two
% methods.
