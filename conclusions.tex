Lcalizing faults in a dynamic Web application is challenging
due to its dynamic nature and the interactions between the
application and the databases. In this paper, we present
{\tool}, our database-aware fault localization method for Web
programs, is able to detect output faults in PHP statements and
in the predicates of \code{WHERE} clauses in SQL queries. In
{\tool}, an PHP interpreter is instrumented to execute the query and
monitor the evaluation of the predicates to decide if they
affect the output of individual records. It performs row-based slicing
across PHP and SQL to record the entities exercised in the output
process of each row. Finally, {\tool}'s predicate switching identifies
suspicious predicates. Our empirical evaluation shows that
it can achieve high~accuracy.
