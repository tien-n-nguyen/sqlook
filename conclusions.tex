%This paper presents {\tool}, 

Lcalizing faults in a dynamic Web application is challenging due to
its dynamic nature and the interactions between the application and
the databases. In this paper, we present {\tool}, our database-aware
fault localization method for Web programs, is able to detect output
faults in PHP statements and in the predicates of \code{WHERE} clauses
in SQL queries. In {\tool}, an PHP interpreter is instrumented to
execute the query and monitor the evaluation of the predicates to
decide if they affect the output of individual records. It performs
row-based slicing across PHP and SQL to record the entities exercised
in the output process of each row. Finally, {\tool}'s predicate
switching identifies suspicious predicates. Our empirical evaluation
shows that {\tool} can achieve higher accuracy than the
state-of-the-art approach. For single-fault scenarios, around 84\% of
the seeded faults are correctly identified by {\tool} with a single
recommendation. For multiple-fault scenarios, 60\% of the cases have
their faults detected in the top-2 list.
