In a PHP Web application, program faults may be found in regular PHP
statements or those that interact with the database, called
\emph{database-interaction points} (e.g. line 4 of
Fig.~\ref{fig:example-phpcode}). The goal of this step is to
localize these faults, specifically to decide if a
database-interaction point contains a fault(s) at its \query{WHERE}
clause or not. To do that, {\tool} uses
%the statistical suspiciousness metric
Tarantula~\cite{tarantula05} to compute the suspiciousness scores for
all entities in PHP and in SQL \code{WHERE} clauses. To avoid the
issues as in Clark {\em et al.}~\cite{ga-ase11}'s approach, we have
following key design strategies:

(1) {\em Row-based test cases}. 
%As explained in Section 2.2., 
Instead of viewing the input and entire expected output from the
database as one test case, we analyze individual data records in
the actual and expected outputs to create row-based test cases. For
example, in Fig.~\ref{fig:example-output}, we have 4 row-based test
cases: 1) the input \code{\$age=25, \$gender=`Female',
\$country=`USA'} and the output of \code{Alice}'s record, 2) that
input and the absence of \code{Bob}'s, 3) that input and the output of
\code{Carol}'s, and 4) that input and the output of \code{Daniel}'s.

(2) {\em Monitoring the execution of PHP and SQL entities via
instrumentation.} The suspiciousness scores are given to PHP
statements and SQL \code{WHERE} clause(s). Instead of passing the
control to the database engine to execute an SQL command as in 
%Clark {\em et al.}
\cite{ga-ase11}, {\tool} instruments into an PHP interpreter the code
to execute the SQL command (Fig.~\ref{fig:SQL-Transformed}) and to
observe the evaluation of the \code{WHERE} clause with respect to
every row-based test case.  Because the \code{WHERE} clause's value
decides if the output of a row-based test case is present or not,
{\tool} needs to record if that clause is evaluated to \code{True} or
\code{False}. From that, it knows which part (\code{True} or
\code{False}) of~a \code{WHERE} clause is exercised for a row-based
test case. Thus, the suspiciousness metric can now be applied not only
to PHP code, but also to the deeper level of the two parts of a
\code{WHERE} clause.

(3) {\em Row-based Slicing across PHP and SQL.} Since {\tool} uses
row-based test cases, it needs to record the PHP statements that are
exercised in the execution of such a test case, i.e. the PHP
statements that are involved in the output of a data record (i.e. a
row). To do that, during the monitoring in step (2), it computes the
forward slice corresponding to each data row across the PHP statements
and the two parts of \code{WHERE}.
%To do that, {\tool} uses the statistical suspiciousness metric
%Tarantula~\cite{tarantula05} to compute the suspiciousness scores for
%all entities in PHP and in SQL \code{WHERE} clause(s). To avoid the
%issue(s) as in Clark {\em et al.}~\cite{ga-ase11}'s approach, we have
%following key design strategies:

%In a PHP web application, program faults may be found in regular PHP
%statements or those that interact with the database system (i.e.,
%\emph{database-interaction points}). To detect these faults, \tool{}
%uses a suspiciousness metric $Sus$, which can be any of the existing
%statistical suspiciousness metrics (such as
%Tarantula~\cite{tarantula05} and Ochiai~\cite{abreu-ochiai-07}), and
%computes the suspiciousness scores for all statements in a PHP program
%including database interaction points. However, as illustrated in the
%motivating example, the faults that exist in database-interaction
%points may not be identified by the metric $Sus$. To further handle
%this type of faults, \tool{} monitors the execution of SQL queries at
%database-interaction points where the conditions given by the
%\query{WHERE} parts of the SQL queries are evaluated to select data
%records from one or more database tables. If the evaluation results of
%the \query{WHERE} conditions do not meet the expected outcomes for
%certain records, \tool{} will increase the suspiciousness scores of
%those \query{WHERE} conditions to indicate that they are likely to
%contain faults. Unlike the technique proposed by Clark et
%al.~\cite{ga-ase11}, by monitoring the execution of SQL \query{WHERE}
%conditions, \tool{} can increase the suspiciousness scores of faulty
%conditions in SQL queries even when there exists only one unique SQL
%query per database-interaction point.
