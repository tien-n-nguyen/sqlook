Localizing and fixing software faults is an important software
maintenance task in improving software quality. In a dynamic Web
application, localizing the faults is challenging due to its dynamic
nature and the interactions between the application and the
databases. The faults could occur in the statements in the host
program or inside the queries that are sent from the application to be
executed in the database engines. This paper presents {\tool}, a novel
database-aware fault localization method/tool that is able to locate
output faults in PHP statements of a dynamic Web application as well
as in the predicates of the \code{WHERE} expressions in SQL
queries. In {\tool}, a PHP interpreter is instrumented to execute an
SQL query and to monitor the evaluation of those SQL predicates to
determine if they affect the output process of individual data
records. It performs row-based slicing across PHP statements and SQL
queries to record the entities that are involved in the output of each
data row. Finally, it uses predicate switching to identify the
suspicious predicates in an SQL query. Our empirical evaluation shows
that {\tool} can achieve higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art
database-aware fault localization approach.
